# Testing Your Ruby Code - Enumerable

This project was 100% built with Ruby. Created Enumerables class methods. Also worked on how to create methods inside classes.

This is the list of the methods that we created:

```
my_each
my_each_with_index
my_select
my_all?
my_any?
my_none?
my_count
my_map
my_inject
multiply_els
```

## üîß Built With

- Ruby.
- Using Rubocop Linters.

## Running tests with Rspec

This methods were tested with Rspec wich is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.

## How to get Rspec running

- In the terminal, type `gem install rspec`
- Once done, go to project directory and type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside spec folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.
- In the terminal, type `rspec`
